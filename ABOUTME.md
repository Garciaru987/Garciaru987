- 👋 Hi, I’m @Garciaru987
- 👀 I’m interested in ... 
  learning about computers, that is a reason why I chose to major in computer engineering. I am also interested in learning how operating systems fucntion in this class
  hopefully by the end of the semester I will have a better understandin on how an operating system works. One last thing I would be interested in learning is how
  different operating systems differ from one another such as MacOS, Windows, Linux, and what their pros and cons are.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... 
  A lot of things for this semester the classes seem to focus more on software compared to last semester where it was hardware stuff. I am currently learning about vectors
  and matrices in Calc 3 this semester. It has been a while since I've taken Calc 2, but according to my professor apparently material learned in Calc 2 is hardly done 
  in Calc 3. Hopefully Calc 3 is easy like some people say it is cause Calc 2 was awful. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... 
  group assignments with some of my classmates to get to know them better and hopefully make some new friends this semester. There are some classes where we are allowed 
  to group up for some assignments through this hopefully I get to meet new people with my major or something similar like Computer Science or any STEM major that is. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
I would say how to reach me, but I kinda dont want to share personal info, I guess the only way to reach out would be through my school email which is:
andres.garcia04@student.csulb.edu
